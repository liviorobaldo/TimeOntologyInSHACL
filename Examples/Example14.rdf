#This final example is about infinite intervals, which we propose to represent via the classes minusInfinite and plusInfinite.
#This is example (36) on the paper at the end of Section 7. The knowledge graph below is invalid for two reasons: 
# - The instant abox:tb, whose value is +infinite, is set at the beginning of the time:TemporalEntity abox:T. This is not possible: a time:TemporalEntity cannot start at +infinite.
# - The instant abox:tb, whose value is +infinite, occurs before the time:TemporalEntity abox:t. This is not possible: +infinite cannot be lower of anything.
abox:tb rdf:type time:plusInfinite. 
abox:T time:hasBeginning abox:tb. 
abox:tb time:before abox:t.
