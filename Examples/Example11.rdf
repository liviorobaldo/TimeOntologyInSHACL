#This knowledge graph is invalid, as correctly detected by our SHACL axiomatization.
#The SHACL-SPARQL rules that implement the first-order logic axioms associated with time:intervalStarts infer that the beginning of abox:i1
#is equal to the beginning of abox:i2 (i.e., abox:b2). Since abox:i1 is an instance of the class time:ProperInterval, the defining axiom
#of this class (axiom "6." in Table 3) infers that the beginning of abox:i1 occurs before its end, which is again abox:b2.
#Now, because the beginning of abox:i1 is equal to abox:b2, axiom "5." in Table 2 infers that abox:b2 occurs before itself.
#This is, of course, invalid, since the time:before property is anti-reflexive, as correctly detected by the corresponding SHACL-SPARQL shape.
#Note that this invalid information also triggers further invalidations.

abox:i1 time:intervalStarts abox:i2.
abox:i2 time:hasBeginning abox:b2.
abox:i1 time:hasEnd abox:b2.
