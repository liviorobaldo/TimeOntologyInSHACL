#This knowledge graph is invalid, as correctly detected by our SHACL axiomatization.
#Since i1 is related to i2 through time:intervalDuring, it is inferred that abox:i2's beginning occurs before abox:i1's beginning, 
#and abox:i1's end occurs before abox:i2's end. Similarly, abox:i3's beginning occurs before abox:i2's beginning, and abox:i2's end occurs before abox:i3's end.
#From this, the transitivity of time:before infers that abox:i1's end occurs before abox:i3's end. This is, of course, incompatible with the triple 
#"abox:i1 time:after abox:i3", from which it is derived that both endpoints of abox:i3 occur before both endpoints of abox:i1. 
#Therefore, a cycle of time:before properties is again inferred, which is subsequently identified as invalid by the SHACL-SPARQL shapes.

abox:i1 time:intervalDuring abox:i2.
abox:i2 time:intervalDuring abox:i3.
abox:i1 time:after abox:i3.
