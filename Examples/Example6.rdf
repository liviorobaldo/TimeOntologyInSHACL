#This knowledge graph is invalid because the two time:TemporalEntity(s) abox:T1 and abox:T2, are asserted to be related by time:intervalEquals. Consequently, the axiom defined
#on time:intervalEquals derive them as instances of time:ProperInterval as well as they are also related by the more abstract relation time:equals.
#Then, the SHACL-SPARQL rules corresponding to axioms 6 and 7 in Table 2 infer that the beginnings and ends of one temporal entity are also the beginnings and ends of the other. #These are then inferred to be pairwise equal by the SHACL-SPARQL rules corresponding to axioms 4 and 5 in Table 3. However, since abox:te11 and abox:te21 are associated with
#different xsd:dateTime values, the knowledge graph is detected as invalid.
#Note that this invalid information also triggers further invalidations.
