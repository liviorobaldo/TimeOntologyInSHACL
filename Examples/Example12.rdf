#This knowledge graph is invalid, as correctly detected by our SHACL axiomatization.
#abox:i1 and abox:i2 are inferred to be instances of time:ProperInterval because they are connected by time:intervalAfter,
#while abox:ii1 and abox:ii2 are inferred to be instances of time:Instant because they occur as the object of time:inside.
#Two endpoints are created for abox:i1 and two more for abox:i2. Moreover, since the two proper intervals are related by time:intervalAfter,
#it is inferred that the end of abox:i2 occurs before the beginning of abox:i1.
#Furthermore, since abox:ii1 occurs inside abox:i1 and abox:ii2 occurs inside abox:i2, it is inferred that abox:ii2 occurs before abox:ii1.
#However, this is incompatible with abox:ii2 time:hasBeginning abox:ii1, from which it follows that the two time:Instant instances are equal.
#This results in abox:ii1 and abox:ii2 being inferred to occur before one another, which is then identified as invalid by the SHACL-SPARQL shapes.
